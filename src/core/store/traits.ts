/**
 * TRAITS ON A MEMORY — the `traits` table's shape and the one check every
 * write of it crosses (folded into the unreleased schema v9, 2026-09-27;
 * designed with the owner and held lightly).
 *
 * A trait nudge says that a memory SHOWS HOW I ACTED, on one of seven axes.
 * Each axis is a spectrum between two good things; the first pole is roughly
 * where training puts me, so a nudge toward the second is the one that says
 * something. Most memories carry none — a nudge is recorded only when the
 * moment really showed it, the way a feeling is recorded at the time.
 *
 * One row per nudge: `axis` (an id from `TRAIT_AXES`), `toward` (one of that
 * axis's two poles), `strength` 0..1, `carried_by` (briefly, what in the
 * moment showed it). Recorded once and never recomputed.
 *
 * DISPLAY ONLY in v1 (working default, 2026-09-27). Nothing reads a trait to
 * decide anything: not core, the lanes, the self page, salience or recall.
 * The dashboard draws each axis's balance itself; the store computes no
 * profile, and the reflection that may write a nudge is shown no balance.
