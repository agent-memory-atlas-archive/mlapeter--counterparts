/**
 * CHAPTERS AS SLICES (2026-09-28, held lightly). An episode row is a session's
 * journal: every chapter in one body under `## chapter N — … · lived day D`
 * headings (`self/episodes.ts#chapterHeading`). Those headings are the seams a
 * remembered day is cut at — the brain keeps slices where something changed and
 * skips between them, and never drops the end. So the dream and the reflection
 * read an episode as its ENTRIES: a line for each, the whole of the ones that
 * matter most, and a count of the ones already dreamed over.

 * Reads only; nothing here writes.
