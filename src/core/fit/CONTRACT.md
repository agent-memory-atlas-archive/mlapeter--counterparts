# `fit/` — CONTRACT

*Added 2026-09-28 (build B), from the owner's conversation of that day and the two notes
behind it (`2026-09-28-brain-compression-research.md`, `2026-09-28-brain-principle-audit.md`,
kept privately). A working default, held lightly: revise it when a real night shows it wrong.*

## 1. The principle (working default, 2026-09-28)

When a mechanism has more than it can take in, it **labels, ranks, and says so** rather than
cutting by position.

- **A line for everything** in the candidate set (a night's new memories, the core, a few
  days' chapter entries). The **whole text for the most important**, by the labels the
  mechanism itself ranks by. **Ids, and a named, batchable lookup, for the rest.**
- **Count what waits, and carry it over.** What a run cannot take tonight is not dropped: it
  waits, with a count, for a window; past the window it goes back to ordinary fading, and that
  count is said too.
- **Hard budgets live at the host's ceilings** — about 10,000 characters of hook injection, and
  about 25,000 tokens per tool result — and a model's own context. At those, compress, or
  deliver in parts. Everywhere else a number is a page size or a nightly rate.
- **Cuts are stated.** Every excerpt carries its whole length (`chars`).
- **The lookup is measured.** If receivers do not use it, the lines are too thin or the
  instruction is unclear — and "index + look up more" has become truncation again.

## 2. Brain analog

The brain tags moments as they happen (surprise, feeling, reward, what is coming), replays a
selection by tag at night within a limited capacity, and what misses tonight is mostly caught
up the next night (Schönauer 2015; the research note, Part 1 §2 and §7). A remembered day is
slices with gaps, not its first two thirds (Jeunehomme & D'Argembeau). Working memory holds a
few chunks and reaches the rest through pointers.

## 3. What the module holds

- `fit(candidates, { room, excerptChars, least })` — the fitter. The caller brings each
  candidate's **priority** (the fitter computes none: the dream ranks by replay priority, the
  reflection by feeling), its line and its whole text. Breadth first: ids (or lines, with
  `least: "line"`) for all in priority order, then lines, then whole texts, each pass filling
  past a misfit. Returns what each was shown as (`whole | excerpt | line | id`), with its whole
  length, the ids that wait, and a report in one shape for every mechanism:
  `{ candidates, whole, excerpt, lined, ids, waiting, agedOut }`.
- `lineOf(row, bytes)` — what a memory is called in one line: its title, else its first
  substantive line (markdown markers and chapter headings passed over), byte-bounded, the cut
  said with "…". Derived at read; nothing stored. Titles stay the writer's: nothing here fills
  one in (a title is also a recall handle, and it is searched with the body).
- `derivedFrom(row)` — what a row was made from, one reader over the meta keys that say it
  (`mergedFrom`, `sources`, `cites`, `groundedIn`, `revisedFrom`, `updates`, `migratedFrom`,
  `reminderFrom`, `episodeId`).
- `packParts(pieces, first, later)` — a list too long for one result, in parts.
- **The lookup ledger** — each mechanism's latest index (`fit.index.<mechanism>` in meta, one
  row per mechanism, overwritten): which ids it offered at which fidelity, its later parts, and
  which offered ids a lookup has since fetched. `noteLookups(store, ids)` counts, per
  mechanism, the expanded ids an index offered only in part; `fidelityOf` says what a change
  was made from (whole, an excerpt, a line — or whole, fetched since).

## 4. Who uses it (2026-09-28)

- `dream/` — the queue of undreamed memories, tonight's room, detail by importance, chapter
  entries as slices, the bundle in parts, fidelity on merges and gists.
- `dream/reflect.ts` — the whole core, every candidate and the last few days as lines at least,
  the most felt whole, chapters as slices, fidelity per item.
- `adapters/mcp` — the recall tool counts lookups against the ledger (the `mcp.recall` row's
  `fromIndex`); `claude-code/doctor.ts` surfaces the count (`Lookups`).

Deliberate recall and the wake composer already fit this way on their own and were left as
they are.

## 5. Guarantees (as of 2026-09-28)

- A placed item's `chars` is its whole text's length; an excerpt ends "…".
- The fitter's order is the caller's priority; ties keep the caller's order.
- The ledger holds ids and labels only — no words — so removing a memory leaves no copy of its
  words here.
- Arithmetic and bookkeeping only: nothing here calls a model.

## 6. Drops

- Cutting by position (`slice(0, N)` on a newest-first list) for the mechanisms above.
- The dream's `MAX_NEW`, `TEXT_CHARS`, `CHAPTER_CHARS`, `MAX_CHAPTERS`; the reflection's
  `CORE`, `CANDIDATES`, `RECENT`, `TEXT_CHARS`, `CHAPTER_CHARS`, `MAX_CHAPTERS`.
