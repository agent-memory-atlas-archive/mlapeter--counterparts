 * this module's own stability constant (`S_EDGE`). One curve family, two
 * constants, which is what "a physics-family curve, own constants" means.

 * every state-changing operation returns the NEXT rows for the caller to persist —

 *    exponential family, which is why the shape is pinned (NOTES.md §4).
