/**
 * `associate/` — Hebbian linking and spreading activation.
 *
 * Memories credited together in one turn become linked; recall spreads activation
 * across those links. The module's spine:
 *
 *   `tunables.ts`  every knob, in one visible place (CAL where uncalibrated)
 *   `edges.ts`     the edge arithmetic — increment, cap, lived-day decay, homeostasis
 *   `buffer.ts`    the DECLARED durability exemption: per-turn deltas in memory
 *   `spread.ts`    a pure traversal `recall/` can consume as a fourth channel
 *   `index.ts`     the binding: observer stance, the flush ordering, telemetry
 *
 * Three properties are structural here and worth stating at the top:
 *
 * **OBSERVERS TRAIN NOTHING, checked before any other work** (contract G7, scar
 * E7). `coactivate()` under an observer stance does not evaluate eligibility, does
 * not compute a delta, and does not touch the buffer — an instrument leaves the
 * graph exactly as it found it. The stand-down is EVENTED, because a stood-down
 * instrument must be distinguishable from a broken hook.
 *
 * **AT MOST ONCE, and the direction of the failure is CHOSEN** (contract G4).
 * `flush()` drains the buffer FIRST and publishes SECOND, and it never restores a
 * drained batch. A crash between the two loses one flush's deltas; there is no
 * ordering in which the same delta lands twice. Restore-on-failure is precisely
 * the trap — if the write landed and the throw came afterwards, a restored buffer
 * double-applies on retry, which is the inversion v1 shipped. Bounded loss is
 * inside tolerance; doubling is what the contract rules out.
 *
 * **A FAILED PUBLISH EMITS NO SUCCESS EVENT** (contract G6, scar §2.4). The
 * `associate.flush.done` event is emitted after `linkMany` returns, never before,
 * and the failure arm emits `associate.flush.failed` with the dropped count.
