/**
 * Spreading activation — a PURE traversal.
 *
 * Seeds plus edge data in, activation contributions out. It reads no store, calls
 * no model, and writes nothing: the graph arrives as two functions the caller
 * supplies (`edgesFrom`, `conducts`), which is what makes the erase test
 * expressible at all — "a removed id stops conducting" is a property of the
 * predicate, not of a deletion that has to be chased through a cache.
 *
 * `recall/` consumes this as its hop channel (wired by `core/retrieval.ts`):
 * contributions modulate candidates the conversation reached, and since
 * 2026-09-28 a memory only the graph reached may become a quiet pointer — that
 * decision is recall's gate's, not this module's (INTERFACE-GAPS.md §1).
 *
 * Bounds:
 *   - **depth** — `HOPS` hops, and a node is expanded once;
 *   - **fan** — a node passes activation in proportion to each edge's ABSOLUTE
 *     weight against the homeostatic bound (`MAX_OUT_WEIGHT`), and never more
 *     than its whole outgoing weight allows, so a hub cannot flood
 *     (`FAN_NORMALIZATION`, NOTES.md §6, 2026-09-28);
 *   - **threshold** — a node is expanded only while it carries at least
 *     `SPREAD_MIN_FRACTION` of the strongest seed (2026-09-28);
 *   - **size** — `MAX_SPREAD_NODES` expansions, a host-cost backstop, and the
 *     result says when it bound instead of quietly returning less.
 *
 * ORDER: best-first across depths (2026-09-28, association build 2) — one
 * queue over what each node carries, so the budget goes where activation is,
 * not to whichever seed or depth happened to come first (see `spread()`).
