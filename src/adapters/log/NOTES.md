# `log/` — NOTES

## 2026-09-30 — the first build

- **Measured before building:** a hermetic SessionStart, prompt, two Stops, SessionEnd and a
  worker run emit several dozen distinct names across the rings. The allowlist keeps about a
  dozen of them. The heavy ones left out are `store.*` (including
  `store.event.appended`, which fires once per durable row and would have doubled every row)
  and the per-prompt recall family.
- **Volume, measured in review:** a SessionStart and three prompt/Stop turns, with the
  worker's lines counted, came to 30 lines and 5,959 bytes — about 10–11 lines and ~2 KB a
  turn. The prompt's `process.start` was dropped after that (review of #286), one line a
  turn less: a prompt is the most frequent event, its end carries `ms`, and it only says
  `reason`. Stop, SessionStart, the worker, the nightly run and the server keep their start
  lines, because a start with no end is the evidence a process was killed.
- **`clean` is a guard on values, not a list of fields.** Emitters already keep to codes and
  counts; the guard is there so a future emitter's path or sentence reaches the file as
  `[text:N]`, not as itself. `/` is allowed in the middle of a value (for the error location,
  `adapters/claude-code/hooks.ts:123`); a leading `/` or `~`, and `..`, are not.
- **`errorFields` never reads a message.** For something thrown that is not an `Error` it
  writes the value's type (`error: "string"`, `code: "UNKNOWN"`) and no location.
- **The hook opens its log only after the store has opened** (review of #286). The first
  version opened it before, so a store this build refuses got a start line and an end by a
  throw — and since pruning lives in `noteSession`, which a refused store never reaches, those
  files were never pruned. Now a refused store gets nothing; its stand-down marker, stderr
  and `systemMessage` already say so. The adapter's events reach the log through a
  forwarding closure, like the server's.
- **`counterparts log` narrates only `LOG_NARRATED`** (`cli/commands.ts`): `adapter.boundary`,
  `adapter.ask`, `adapter.wake.injected` — each emitted by `hooks.ts#record`, so the ring data
  IS the durable payload — and the two new rows. Every other name prints `key=value`. The
  dashboard's sentences read durable payloads, and on ring data some state false facts
  (`handoff.written` from the ring said "showing for 0 days"). Chosen over "sentence then
  key=value" to keep one line short; a name joins the list once its ring data is checked.
- **`clean` lets a single token through** — a word, an email, a URL, a relative path. So the
  one model-typed value that reached a line, `mcp.write_up`'s `ref` (the `writeUp` argument),
  is now written only for a session the registry knows (`isSessionId` and `readSession`).
  `isSessionId` alone was not enough: `SecretWordBravo` passes it.
- **Bun's `rmSync(dir, { force: true })` throws on a directory**, empty or not (measured,
  bun 1.3.10), so `pruneSessions` cannot remove `sessions/log/`. The test pins it with the
  directory's mtime set a month back.
- **The MCP server opens its log after the store**, because the store is what resolves the
  directory; the counterpart's `onEvent` is a forwarding closure until then. Events emitted
  while the store opens are not logged (none of them is on the list unless it fails, and a
  failure there throws).
- **`process.end`'s `reason`** is the process's own word: the hook's `HookResult.reason`, the
  worker's `RunReport.reason`, the night run's state (its own reason goes in `why`), and
  `stdin-closed` for the server.
- **A new `localTime` in `core/time.ts`** (`HH:MM:SS`, 24-hour) for `counterparts log`: the
  date is the file's, and seconds are what tell two lines apart.
