/* The home tab (round 4, 2026-09-28 — a try, judged when seen): the best
   pictures from the other tabs, for someone who knows roughly what this is
   and none of the details. Clicking anything takes you to that thing on its
   own tab. Top to bottom:
     - one headline ("Day 7 with Mike · 306 memories · 13 new today") and a
       small health dot, linked to Health;
     - the brain (a region opens its mechanism on Health) beside "Today", a few
       plain lines about memory;
     - "How it feels" (the memories tab's radar) beside "Around the core" (the
       Self tab's map).
   The mechanism pills and panel moved to Health; the tiles, the written-vs-
   came-back chart, Tonight and the live feed went.

   Two fetches: `/api/overview` for the words and pictures, `/api/mechanisms`
   for the brain's lights. */
