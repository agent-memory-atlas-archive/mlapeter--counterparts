/* The self tab (was "mind"): the self page on the left with a side column
   beside it (when it was rewritten and by whom, what the page writer did last,
   the page's history as a line of dots, what the next session wakes up with);
   under them, what is settling into the core and the journal as a strip of
   days. One fetch (`/api/mind`).

   LIVE. The pulse calls `refresh()` when the store moves. Only the panels whose
   data changed are redrawn, each from `state.js`, so whatever was open — a
   picked day, expanded chapters, an opened version, a pinned `?`, the wake's
   text — is drawn open again, and the scroll position is put back. */
